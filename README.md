## Hey There!

I am a experienced software engineer with over five years of expertise, deeply passionate about building high-quality and effective software. From business analysis to product implementation, my focus is on creating software that is iteratively scalable, committing myself to the continuous improvement of products throughout their life cycle. I strongly believe in diversity and collaborative work as a drive to achieve team success. I am mostly working with TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js and React recently, but I like to poke around and experiment new technologies at my free time.
