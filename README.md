# Thomaz Zandonotto

## Hey There! 

I am an experienced software engineer with over six years of professional expertise in various programming languages and technologies. I am deeply passionate about crafting high-quality and impactful products, contributing across the entire process of building a successful software, from business analysis to implementation and maintenance.

My professional goal is to create iteratively scalable software, dedicating myself to the continuous improvement of the products I work on. I do my best to foster a culture of collaboration and excellence within the teams I work with, and I strongly believe in diversity as a drive to achieve team success.

While TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, and React form my current technological core, I have previous experience with various other languages and technology stacks, such as Ruby, Java, and PHP. I'm always eager to embrace new challenges, even if they involve technologies I'm less familiar with.
